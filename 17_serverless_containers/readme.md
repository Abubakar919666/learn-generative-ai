# Serverless Containers

We will used Google Cloud Run to deploy serverless containers in the cloud. Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure. You can deploy code written in Python, TypeScript, or any other programming language on Cloud Run if you can build a container image from it.

You can run not only serverless containers but also Cloud Run jobs. A Cloud Run job only runs its tasks and exits when finished. A job does not listen for or serve requests. After you create or update a job, you can: Execute the job as a one-off, on a schedule, or as part of a workflow.

We will be mainly using Cloud Run to develop API's using Python or TypeScript.
