# Containers for Development, Testing, and Deployment

Welcome to the **Containers** section of your **Generative AI** learning journey!

Containers are a key component of modern app development. They are executable units of software that contain all the necessary elements to run in any environment. Containers can virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer's personal laptop. 

Containers allow developers to package everything required to run an app into one convenient location. This permits developers to create the applications and deploy them on servers with the operating system itself, which makes containers very lightweight and portable.

## Containers: The Foundational Technology in Software Development

* According to a recent report by Gartner, by 2027, more than 90% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production.

* Industry reports and surveys suggest around 70% of organizations currently use containers in development.

* Docker has market share of 82.32% in containerization market.

* Over 391,375 companies are using Containers And Microservices tools.

* Research by Forrester suggests that 71% of DevOps adopters use microservices and containers.

* The adoption of containerization technology allows programs to run consistently in development, testing, and production settings.

* The application container market is on the rise, primarily fueled by the adoption of microservices architecture, where large applications are fragmented into smaller, autonomous services. This approach, facilitated by containerization technology, minimizes the complexities in development and deployment, enabling the independent launch and scaling of services.

Ultimately, the future of software development likely involves leveraging the benefits of **containers** alongside other technologies like **APIs**, **serverless computing**, and **GenAI** to meet specific needs and optimize performance.

Together, these technologies create a powerful synergy:

* Microservices architecture built with containers ensures agility and scalability.
* APIs connect these microservices and enable seamless communication.
* GenAI models integrated as microservices or offered through APIs enhance application functionality with intelligent capabilities.
