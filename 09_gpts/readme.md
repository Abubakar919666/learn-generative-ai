**OpenAI GPTs vs Assistants**

OpenAI GPTs and Assistants are two different ways of creating custom chatbots that can leverage the power of ChatGPT and other tools. Here are some of the main differences between them:

- **Creation process**: GPTs can be created by anyone using a simple UI within ChatGPT, while Assistants require coding for integration with the OpenAI API.
- **Operational environment**: GPTs live inside of ChatGPT and can be accessed through its interface, while Assistants can be integrated into any product or service that supports the OpenAI API.
- **Pricing**: GPTs are included in ChatGPT on Plus/Enterprise plans, while Assistants are billed based on the usage of different features.
- **User interface**: GPTs have a built-in UI with ChatGPT that allows users to interact with them, while Assistants are designed for programmatic use and can be visualized using the playground.
- **Shareability**: GPTs have a built-in ability to share them with others, while Assistants do not have a built-in shareability feature.
- **Hosting**: GPTs are hosted by OpenAI, while OpenAI does not host Assistants.
- **Tools**: GPTs have built-in tools like Web Browser, DALLÂ·E, Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Custom Actions, while Assistants have built-in tools like Code Interpreter, Functions, and File Retrieval.
